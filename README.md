# My Simple C Projects
My Basic C Projects

At the moment, here is a list of the current ones:
* Calculator
* Game Solver
  * Tower of Hanoi [Play tower of hanoi](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html0

These are for small, text-based applications that are designed to be short and not have a GUI window apllication. These are all written in **Code Blocks IDE: GCC Compiler**.

Thanks for visiting. If you have any ideas or any of your own small text-based apps, feel free to put in a pull request or an issue.
